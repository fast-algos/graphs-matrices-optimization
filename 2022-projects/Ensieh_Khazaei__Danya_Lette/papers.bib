abstract = {We present algorithms for solving symmetric, diagonally-dominant linear systems to accuracy ε in time linear in their number of non-zeros and log (κf (A) ε), where κf (A) is the condition number of the matrix defining the linear system. Our algorithm applies the preconditioned Chebyshev iteration with preconditioners designed using nearly-linear time algorithms for graph sparsification and graph partitioning.},

abstract = {We prove that any graph G=(V,E) with n points and m edges has a spanning tree T such that ∑(u,v)∈ E(G)dT(u,v) = O(m log n log log n). Moreover such a tree can be found in time O(m log n log log n). Our result is obtained using a new petal-decomposition approach which guarantees that the radius of each cluster in the tree is at most 4 times the radius of the induced subgraph of the cluster in the original graph.},
