With that said, we conclude this write-up. Through this, we covered the following key points:

1. Applications and background of sparsification
2. Spectral sparsification
3. Reduction from the sparsification problem to the matrix approximation problem
4. The main method of twice Ramanujan sparsification
5. Experimental details and introducing our package
6. Drawing connections between sparsified complete graphs and expenders 
7. measuring how good the sparsifiers are in terms of Ramanujan-like bounds.
