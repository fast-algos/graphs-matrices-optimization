% \title{Bounding the norm of the residual of the approximate solution}

I struggled to understand the proof of a claim in the section about approximate linear regression
in the reference that you recommended~\cite[page 31]{DBLP:journals/corr/Woodruff14}.
Here is a \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4357.pdf}{link} to the pdf for convenience.
He says that if we let $S$ be the span of the columns of $A$ union $b$,
and we have a JL transform, $\Pi$, for which
\begin{align}
\label{eq:bounds}
    \forall y \in S ~~ (1-\epsilon)\norm{y} \leq \norm{\Pi y} \leq (1+\epsilon)\norm{y} 
\end{align}
then it follows that 
\begin{align}
    \norm{b - A\tilde{w}} \leq (1 + \epsilon) \norm{b - Aw^*},
\end{align}
where 
\begin{align}
    w^* = \argmin_w \norm{b - Aw} & & \tilde{w} = \argmin_w \norm{\Pi(b - Aw)}.
\end{align}
We do bound the error, however, from what I can tell, 
if we only invoke the bounds of Equation~\ref{eq:bounds},
and don't explicitly consider that $\Pi$ is a linear transform, 
we get that
\begin{align*}
    \norm{b - A\tilde{w}} 
        &\leq \norm{b - Aw^*} + \epsilon \norm{b - Aw^*} + \epsilon \norm{b - A\tilde{w}} \\
        &\leq (1 + \epsilon) \norm{b - Aw^*} + \epsilon \norm{b - A\tilde{w}} \\ 
        &\leq \frac{(1 + \epsilon)}{(1 - \epsilon)} \norm{b - Aw^*} \\
        &\leq (1 + 2\epsilon + O(\epsilon^2))\norm{b - Aw^*}
\end{align*}
See the figure on the next page for a visual.

I know that with the above bound we could rescale $\epsilon$ by a constant
and keep the same order of the embedding dimension.
My worse case analysis in the figure is also avoided due to the 
fact that $\Pi$ is a linear transform. 
There's no way the $\tilde{w}$ could be in that position without non-linearities in the embedding.
(And we know from the latter proof, we can get away with far fewer rows in the embedding.)
But I still don't see how the $(1+\epsilon)$ bound 
simply ``follows'' from Equation~\ref{eq:bounds}.
I can't tell if David's proof misses this subtlety, 
or if he's implicitly invoking something else that I don't see. 
Is that clear to you?
