In class previously, 
we saw the \textit{Johnson-Lindenstrauss} (JL) Lemma,
which showed that a set of $k$ vectors in $\rea^n$,
can be embedded into $m=\calO(\epsilon^{-2}\log k)$ dimensions,
while approximately preserving
all pairwise distances simultaneously, up to a $1+\epsilon$ distortion factor.
Moreover, it is possible to sample a \textit{linear} embedding function,
in polynomial-time, and that function does not depend the set of vectors, 
i.e., it is \textit{oblivious}.
%
\begin{theorem}[Johnson–Lindenstrauss Lemma]
    \label{thm:jl_lemma}
    For any $\epsilon \in (0, 1/2]$ and $V = \{\xx_1, \xx_2, ..., \xx_k\} \subset \rea^n$,
    there exists a linear mapping $\Pi:\rea^n \mapsto \rea^m$ for $m =\calO(\epsilon^{-2}\log k)$ such that
    \begin{align}
        \label{eq:jl_cond}
        \forall i,j~~(1-\epsilon) \norm{\xx_i - \xx_j} 
        \leq \norm{\Pi\xx_i - \Pi\xx_j} 
        \leq (1+\epsilon)\norm{\xx_i - \xx_j}
    \end{align}
\end{theorem}
%
While it was not given this name in class, 
the JL-Lemma follows from another result 
known as the Distributional Johnson–Lindenstrauss Lemma. 
%
\begin{theorem}[Distributional Johnson–Lindenstrauss Lemma]
    \label{thm:dist_jl}
    There exists a distribution over random matrices, $\Pi:\rea^n \mapsto \rea^m$,
    such that if $m=\calO(\epsilon^{-2}\log(1/\delta))$, then for any $\xx \in \rea^n$
    \begin{align*}
        \pr \left[ (1-\epsilon) \norm{\xx} \leq \norm{\Pi\xx} \leq (1+\epsilon)\norm{\xx} \right]
            \geq 1-\delta.
    \end{align*}
\end{theorem}
%
This follows easily from the ``main lemma'' used in class to prove of the JL-Lemma.
We can similarly prove Theorem \ref{thm:jl_lemma} from \ref{thm:dist_jl} with a union bound over the 
$\binom{k}{2}$ distances vectors in $V$.
Picking $\delta = \delta'/\binom{k}{2} = \Omega(\delta'/k^2)$, 
it follows that if $m=\calO(\epsilon^{-2}\log(k^2/\delta'))=\calO(\epsilon^{-2}\log(k/\delta'))$,
then Equation~\ref{eq:jl_cond} occurs with probability at least $1-\delta'$.
(In class we let $\delta' = 1/k$.)
